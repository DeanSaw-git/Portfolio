     <p>I have a background in working for the NHS where I was a stock controller. During this time, the surgery that i worked at received an 'Outstanding' mark from the CQC (Care Quality Commision) I learnt alot in this role, i obtained a Level 2 NVQ in customer service, and it really emphasised to me the importance of confidentiality. <br><br> When i left the NHS i found a new role as a territory coordinator for maintenance engineers with CDA. I enjoyed the role but i knew it wasnt somewhere i wanted to be permanantly. <br> <br>I have always had a strong interest in computers, whether it was gaming on them or building them. I decided to do some research into how i could get my foot in the door with Software Development and my journey began with a 3 month bootcamp. I feel like i have finally found a career that i want to be involved in for the rest of my life, something that fully captures my attention, and excites me to learn and further develop my skill set.</p>
